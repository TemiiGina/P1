<h1>Temi Gina Process</h1>

<p>The inspiration for this project was large family gatherings at a house. Throughout the summer, my family would host fun outdoor events where we would all talk, play games, and most importantly, eat.
    my project aims to replicate the experience of leaving the festivities for a quick snack on the table in the house. There are different food options, and you try a bit of everything.

<h2>Planning</h2>

<br>
<p>My project is a compilation of different interactive foods, so I started by drafting out different food items I could make.
    The image above shows my different ideas and possible ways of executing them. In this planning stage I also astablished a broad colour pallete of mainly pastels.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>

<p>As I was creating the website, I had to make some alterations to my initial designs, most of them being the simplifications and the substitution of css generated shapes with my own drawings.
    For instance, several of my designs required radomly generted elements, which is a limitaion of CSS. Certain ideas where just impossible to create using CSS, there
    was initially supposed to be a plate of fries that the user would hover over and generate a red line following the mouse, to represent ketchup, however this
    needed to be done using JavaScript's mouse_position() feature.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Working on this projects taught me key concepts about CSS and HTML and how to combine and manipulate them to create dynamic and intertive shapes and compositions.
    Due to my initial ideas that involved many moving parts, I forced to find creative solutions for CSS problems I faced.</p>
